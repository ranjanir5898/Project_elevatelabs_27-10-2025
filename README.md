# YouTube Trending Video Analytics 

This project analyzes global YouTube trending videos to uncover engagement trends, regional performance, and content popularity patterns. Data was collected using the YouTube Data API v3, ensuring real-time accuracy across multiple regions.

The dataset was processed using Python (Pandas, Requests) for data cleaning and transformation, with PostgreSQL handling structured storage and querying. Key metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement ratios were computed to measure audience interaction and content success.

## Key Insights:

1. **High Engagement in Specific Regions:** Engagement rates (likes, comments, shares) varied significantly across regions, with certain countries showing stronger audience interactions despite lower total view counts.[1]

2. **Category Influence:** Entertainment and Music videos dominated the trending list, often maintaining higher engagement ratios compared to other categories like News or Education.[1]

3. **Channel Performance Trends:** Top-performing channels consistently posted at similar times of day and maintained frequent upload schedules, contributing to sustained visibility on the trending list.[1]

4. **Correlation Between Metrics:** Videos with higher like-to-view and comment-to-view ratios tended to remain trending longer, suggesting that **engagement quality outweighs raw view count** in sustaining popularity.[1]

5. **Temporal Patterns:** Posting during weekends and late evenings correlated with spikes in viewership, particularly for entertainment-focused content.[1]

6. **Sentiment and Engagement:** Positive-toned titles and thumbnails were associated with higher click and engagement rates, as visualized through sentiment-based dashboards in Tableau.[1]

7. **Actionable Insight:** Content creators and marketers can use these findings to **optimize video timing, audience targeting, and engagement strategy** for better trend performance.[1]

## Using Tableau, interactive dashboards were built to visualize insights like:

    Publishing trends over time

    Top-performing channels and categories

    Like-to-view and comment-to-view ratios

    Regional differences in engagement levels

The analysis equips content creators and marketers with data-driven insights to refine video strategy and audience targeting.
